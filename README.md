# python
This is a python repo for a small script that will calculate the amount of money you'll make when working Over Time.
I often work after hours at rates of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 times my normal rate. This will be a quick way of seeing how much I'm going to earn in a given week of OT work.

The script will prompt you to enter your normal hourly rate and will then calculate your 1.5, 2 and 2.5 rates. It'll store this in a file so you don't need to enter the info every time you launch the program.
